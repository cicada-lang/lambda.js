`assert-same` and `assert-not-same` only support two args

# readback

`readback` handle recursive function

# module

refactor `load` to support circular imports

- if we can support mutually defined recursive function,
  we should also support circular imports.

# let

`let-one` vs `let` and `let*`

# lazy evaluation

bring lazy evaluation back
