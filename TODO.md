# readback

`readback` handle recursive function

# module

refactor `load` to support circular imports

  we should also support circular imports.

# let

`let-one` vs `let` and `let*`

# lazy evaluation

bring lazy evaluation back

[example] bring back `factorial-half.lisp`
[example] bring back turing for fixpoint
