# let

`let-one` vs `let` and `let*`

# module

refactor `load` to support circular imports

- if we can support mutually defined recursive function,
  we should also support circular imports.

# lazy evaluation

[problem] we can use `Y`! -- `DelayedApply` can replace `Lazy`? -- what evaluation strategy is this?
[maybe] bring lazy evaluation back
[maybe] remove lazy -- if the new evaluation strategy is good!
